    "--- Day 17: Reservoir Research ---\n",
    "You arrive in the year 18. If it weren't for the coat you got in 1018, you would be very cold: the North Pole base hasn't even been constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather, it hasn't been constructed yet. The Elves are making a little progress, but there's not a lot of liquid water in this climate, so they're getting very dehydrated. Maybe there's more underground?\n",
    "\n",
    "You scan a two-dimensional vertical slice of the ground nearby and discover that it is mostly sand with veins of clay. The scan only provides data with a granularity of square meters, but it should be good enough to determine how much water is trapped there. In the scan, x represents the distance to the right, and y represents the distance down. There is also a spring of water near the surface at x=500, y=0. The scan identifies which square meters are clay (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose your scan shows the following veins of clay:\n",

    "The spring of water will produce water forever. Water can move through sand, but is blocked by clay. Water always moves down when possible, and spreads to the left and right otherwise, filling space that has clay on both sides and falling out otherwise.\n",

    "How many tiles can be reached by the water? To prevent counting forever, ignore tiles with a y coordinate smaller than the smallest y coordinate in your scan data or larger than the largest one. Any x coordinate is valid.
