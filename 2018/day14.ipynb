    "You finally have a chance to look at all of the produce moving around. Chocolate, \n",

    "plants to make hot chocolate! As you realize this, you hear a conversation in the \n",

    "\n",
    "The Elves are trying to come up with the ultimate hot chocolate recipe; they're \n",
    "even maintaining a scoreboard which tracks the quality score (0-9) of each recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only two recipes are on the board: the first recipe got a score of 3, the second, 7. \n",
    "Each of the two Elves has a current recipe: the first Elf starts with the first recipe,\n",
    "and the second Elf starts with the second recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create new recipes, the two Elves combine their current recipes. \n",
    "This creates new recipes from the digits of the sum of the current recipes' scores.\n",

    "After all new recipes are added to the scoreboard, each Elf picks a new current recipe. \n",
    "To do this, the Elf steps forward through the scoreboard a number of recipes \n",

    "the first Elf moves forward 1 + 3 = 4 times, while the second Elf \n",
    "moves forward 1 + 7 = 8 times. If they run out of recipes, they loop back \n",
    "around to the beginning. After the first round, both Elves happen to loop around \n",
    "until they land on the same recipe that they had in the beginning; in general, \n",
    "they will move to different recipes.\n",
